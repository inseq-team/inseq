<details>
  <summary>Dev Installation</summary>
To install the package, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd inseq
make poetry-download # Download and install the Poetry package manager
make install # Installs the package and all dependencies
```

If you have a GPU available, use `make install-gpu` to install the latest `torch` version with GPU support.

For library developers, you can use the `make install-dev` command to install and its GPU-friendly counterpart `make install-dev-gpu` to install all development dependencies (quality, docs, extras).

After installation, you should be able to run `make fast-test` and `make lint` without errors.

  <summary>FAQ Installation</summary>

- Installing the `tokenizers` package requires a Rust compiler installation. You can install Rust from [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) and add `$HOME/.cargo/env` to your PATH.

- Installing `sentencepiece` requires various packages, install with `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential pkg-config` or `brew install cmake gperftools pkg-config`.

## Example usage in Python

This example uses the Integrated Gradients attribution method to attribute the English-French translation of a sentence taken from the WinoMT corpus:

```python
import inseq

model = inseq.load_model("Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr", "integrated_gradients")
out = model.attribute(
  "The developer argued with the designer because her idea cannot be implemented.",
  n_steps=100
)
out.show()
```

This produces a visualization of the attribution scores for each token in the input sentence (token-level aggregation is handled automatically). Here is what the visualization looks like inside a Jupyter Notebook:

Inseq also supports decoder-only models such as [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html), enabling usage of a variety of attribution methods and customizable settings directly from the console:

```python
import inseq

model = inseq.load_model("gpt2", "integrated_gradients")
model.attribute(
    "Hello ladies and",
    generation_args={"max_new_tokens": 9},
    n_steps=500,
    internal_batch_size=50
).show()
```

## Features

- üöÄ Feature attribution of sequence generation for most `ForConditionalGeneration` (encoder-decoder) and `ForCausalLM` (decoder-only) models from ü§ó Transformers

- üöÄ Support for multiple feature attribution methods, sourced in part from [Captum](https://captum.ai/docs/introduction)

- üöÄ Post-processing of attribution maps via `Aggregator` classes.

- üöÄ Attribution visualization in notebooks, browser and command line.

- üöÄ Attribute single examples or entire ü§ó datasets with the Inseq CLI.

- üöÄ Custom attribution of target functions, supporting advanced use cases such as contrastive and uncertainty-weighted feature attributions.

- üöÄ Extraction and visualization of custom step scores (e.g. probability, entropy) alongsides attribution maps.

### Supported methods

Use the `inseq.list_feature_attribution_methods` function to list all available method identifiers and `inseq.list_step_functions` to list all available step functions. The following methods are currently supported:

#### Gradient-based attribution

- `saliency`: [Saliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) (Simonyan et al., 2013)

- `input_x_gradient`: [Input x Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) (Simonyan et al., 2013)

- `integrated_gradients`: [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365) (Sundararajan et al., 2017)

- `deeplift`: [DeepLIFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685) (Shrikumar et al., 2017)

- `gradient_shap`: [Gradient SHAP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295230) (Lundberg and Lee, 2017)

- `discretized_integrated_gradients`: [Discretized Integrated Gradients](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.805/) (Sanyal and Ren, 2021)

#### Internals-based attribution

- `attention`: [Attention Weight Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) (Bahdanau et al., 2014)

#### Perturbation-based attribution

- `occlusion`: [Occlusion](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1_53) (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014)

- `lime`: [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) (Ribeiro et al., 2016)

#### Step functions

Step functions are used to extract custom scores from the model at each step of the attribution process with the `step_scores` argument in `model.attribute`. They can also be used as targets for attribution methods relying on model outputs (e.g. gradient-based methods) by passing them as the `attributed_fn` argument. The following step functions are currently supported:

- `logits`: Logits of the target token.
- `probability`: Probability of the target token.
- `entropy`: Entropy of the predictive distribution.
- `crossentropy`: Cross-entropy loss between target token and predicted distribution.
- `perplexity`: Perplexity of the target token.
- `contrast_prob_diff`: Difference in probability between the target token and a foil token used for contrastive evaluation as in [Contrastive Attribution](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.14/) (Yin and Neubig, 2022).
- `mc_dropout_prob_avg`: Average probability of the target token across multiple samples using [MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142) (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016).

The following example computes contrastive attributions using the `contrast_prob_diff` step function:

```python
import inseq

attribution_model = inseq.load_model("gpt2", "input_x_gradient")

# Pre-compute ids and attention map for the contrastive target
contrast = attribution_model.encode("Can you stop the dog from crying")

# Perform the contrastive attribution:
# Regular (forced) target -> "Can you stop the dog from barking"
# Contrastive target      -> "Can you stop the dog from crying"
out = attribution_model.attribute(
    "Can you stop the dog from",
    "Can you stop the dog from barking",
    attributed_fn="contrast_prob_diff",
    contrast_ids=contrast.input_ids,
    contrast_attention_mask=contrast.attention_mask,
    # We also visualize the corresponding step score
    step_scores=["contrast_prob_diff"]
)
out.show()
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://inseq.readthedocs.io/examples/custom_attribute_target.html) for an example including custom function registration.

## Using the Inseq client

The Inseq library also provides useful client commands to enable repeated attribution of individual examples and even entire ü§ó datasets directly from the console. See the available options by typing `inseq -h` in the terminal after installing the package.

For now, two commands are supported:

- `√¨nseq attribute`: Wraps the `attribute` method shown above, requires explicit inputs to be attributed.

- `inseq attribute-dataset`: Enables attribution for a full dataset using Hugging Face `datasets.load_dataset`.

Both commands support the full range of parameters available for `attribute`, attribution visualization in the console and saving outputs to disk.

**Example:** The following command can be used to perform attribution (both source and target-side) of Italian translations for a dummy sample of 20 English sentences taken from the FLORES-101 parallel corpus, using a MarianNMT translation model from Hugging Face `transformers`. We save the visualizations in HTML format in the file `attributions.html`. See the `--help` flag for more options.

```bash
inseq attribute-dataset \
  --model_name_or_path Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-it \
  --attribution_method saliency \
  --do_prefix_attribution \
  --dataset_name inseq/dummy_enit \
  --input_text_field en \
  --dataset_split "train[:20]" \
  --viz_path attributions.html \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --hide
```

## Planned Development

- ‚öôÔ∏è Support more attention-based and occlusion-based feature attribution methods (documented in [#107](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq/issues/107) and [#108](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq/issues/108)).

- ‚öôÔ∏è Interoperability with [ferret](https://ferret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for attribution plausibility and faithfulness evaluation.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Rich and interactive visualizations in a tabbed interface using [Gradio Blocks](https://gradio.app/docs/#blocks).
