    """The basic attention attribution method, which retrieves the attention weights from the model.

    Attribute Args:
            aggregate_heads_fn (:obj:`str` or :obj:`callable`): The method to use for aggregating across heads.
                Can be one of `average` (default if heads is list, tuple or None), `max`, `min` or `single` (default
                if heads is int), or a custom function defined by the user.
            aggregate_layers_fn (:obj:`str` or :obj:`callable`): The method to use for aggregating across layers.
                Can be one of `average` (default if layers is tuple or list), `max`, `min` or `single` (default if
                layers is int or None), or a custom function defined by the user.
            heads (:obj:`int` or :obj:`tuple[int, int]` or :obj:`list(int)`, optional): If a single value is specified,
                the head at the corresponding index is used. If a tuple of two indices is specified, all heads between
                the indices will be aggregated using aggregate_fn. If a list of indices is specified, the respective
                heads will be used for aggregation. If aggregate_fn is "single", a head must be specified.
                If no value is specified, all heads are passed to aggregate_fn by default.
            layers (:obj:`int` or :obj:`tuple[int, int]` or :obj:`list(int)`, optional): If a single value is specified
                , the layer at the corresponding index is used. If a tuple of two indices is specified, all layers
                among the indices will be aggregated using aggregate_fn. If a list of indices is specified, the
                respective layers will be used for aggregation. If aggregate_fn is "single", the last layer is
                used by default. If no value is specified, all available layers are passed to aggregate_fn by default.

    Example:
        - ``model.attribute(src)`` will return the average attention for all heads of the last layer.
        - ``model.attribute(src, heads=0)`` will return the attention weights for the first head of the last layer.
        - ``model.attribute(src, heads=(0, 5), aggregate_heads_fn="max", layers=[0, 2, 7])`` will return the maximum
            attention weights for the first 5 heads averaged across the first, third, and eighth layers.
